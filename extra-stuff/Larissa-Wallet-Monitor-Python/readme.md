# TBD - Docs to come here

I am uploading the script for now as it may be useful.
When I have more time I will add instructions here.

Sorry for the lack of docks, I will add more in the next few days.  Meanwhile you can at least take a look at the Python script, it may help you get going.

I will elaborate later:
* create a file named wallet_ids.csv
* put your wallet_ids, one on each line

I will add details on how to get the wallet IDs, again when I have time.
